SX280HS / SX275HS / SX270HS notes

CHDK is a hack, use at your own risk!

Additionally, Digic 6 has significant differences from previously 
supported models, which means some features are not fully implemented
and the risk of unforeseen side effects is higher than ports for
previous Digic versions.

Firmware version information can be obtained using the VER.REQ method,
or by using ACID / STICK / exiftool or the firminfo Canon Basic script.


General camera and CHDK port information

- Default ALT button is the PLAYBACK button. VIDEO and DISP may also be used

- The half press zebra shortcut button is MENU

- The RAW shortcut (and generic shortcut) button is DISP

- To start in shooting mode, hold down the ON/OFF button

- Only simple_movie_status is implemented, so features or scripts that rely on
  direct access to the movie_status variable do not work

- Video bitrate can be adjusted (CBR, VBR). Maximum possible video bitrate is approx. 35000 kbit/s

- Video time based limits are raised to 3 hours (only makes sense on external power)

- Using CHDK started via the "firmware update" method has not been fully tested.
  Report any problems in the porting thread.

- GPS data in DNGs is supported on SX280. Full CHDK GPS support is not implemented.

Issues

- Exposure overrides (and custom auto ISO) will not work correctly when
  - "AF frame" is set to "tracking AF" in Canon menu
  - "Servo AF" is enabled in Canon menu
  - "I-contrast" is enabled in Canon menu

- CHDK overlay drawing is slow, Canon display updates make the CHDK OSD blink
- some games do not display correctly
- PTP remote shoot can misbehave in certain shooting modes (sports mode, high speed burst mode, ...):
  when using continuous shooting (rs -cont or rs -quick in chdkptp), the number of actual shots
  may be larger than the requested number, the last shot from such a series may end up on card


Old development notes

- the current overlay drawing method is slow, should be replaced
  (overlay is 16bpp yuv, a separate 8bpp opacity buffer has to be written too)
- screen refresh method is not optimal, slow, the guard pixel gets erased each time the battery warning blinks

- don't forget to transform pc-relative loads into ldr instructions when using objdump output
- when using ldr pc, =... always check the target instruction set and use the appropriate thumb bit
- always check the instruction set of every needed fw function and use the appropriate thumb bit (for stubs)
- be careful with jumptables, 'tbb' may run out of addressable space when inserting new instructions into fw code
- tbb jumptables have to be explicitly aligned, the assembler won't notice alignment problems
- objdump tends to lose sync when it tries to disassemble data blocks, some instructions need to be recovered manually
