G7x notes
************************************
This is an INCOMPLETE, NON-WORKING PORT.
It may be of interest to developers, but it is not yet very useful for photography!
Many shooting related features not implemented or not tested.

CHDK is a hack, use at your own risk!

This camera has an adjustable aperture and ND filter.

TESTED
