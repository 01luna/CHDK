************************************
G7x notes
************************************
This is an INCOMPLETE, MOSTLY UNTESTED PORT.
It may be of interest to developers, but it is not yet very useful for photography!
Many shooting related features not implemented or not tested.

CHDK is a hack, use at your own risk!

This camera has an adjustable aperture and ND filter.

SD override does not work in AF, only MF or AF lock.

Default alt button is PLAY

TESTED
******
llibtst.lua
chdkptp cam tests
PTP play/rec switch
raw and remote hooks (in normal shooting modes, probably broken in star timelapse, hdr etc)
ND override
SD override
setmode.lua - crashes with default 10ms delay, works with 100ms
ubtest.bas
hooktest.lua
isobase.lua

NOT IMPLEMENTED
***************
dark frame control
movie_rec and exp_drv tasks
jogdial support

OTHER ISSUES
************
display updating is ugly
functions that depend on live view (zebra, histogram, edge, PTP live view) won't work

KNOWN BUGS
**********
current CHDK raw hook is often called after jpeg creation, so things that modify raw buffer do not affect jpeg

THANKS

* srsa_4c for the sx280hs port, and doing all the hard work to support digic 6.
