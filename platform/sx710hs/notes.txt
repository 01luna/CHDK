SX710 HS notes
************************************
CHDK is a hack, use at your own risk!

This is an in development PREALPHA port. SOme CHDK features have not been
tested, and some have not been implemented

Additionally, Digic 6 has significant differences from previously 
supported models, which means some features are not fully implemented
and the risk of unforeseen side effects is higher than ports for
previous Digic versions.

The VER.REQ method works to obtain the Canon firmware. VERS.REQ does not

No "firmware update" file is included in the autobuild, you must used
bootable SD card to load. See known bugs below.


General camera and CHDK port information
****************************************
SX710 has an adjustable aperture, and a "hidden" ND filter not
accessible through the Canon UI

Default alt button is PLAY. VIDEO and WIFI may also be used

Subject distance (focus) override is available only when MF or AF lock is set

Only simple_movie_status is implemented, so features or scripts that rely on
direct access to the movie_status variable do not work

When running a script ~500k of RAM is available to CHDK.
