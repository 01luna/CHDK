EOS M10 notes

Default ALT button is the playback button.


Issues

- To start the cam with the playback button, hold down the button a little longer
- To select a digit in a CHDK menu numeric field, press the shutter halfway

- CHDK overlay drawing is slow, default font is tiny
- many GUI modules don't respect screen resolution
- most framebuffer related features do not work, including
    - zebra
    - histogram (camera has a native one though)
    - edge overlay
    - custom auto iso overexposure protection
- booting with .fi2 is untested, but most likely makes the camera unstable
- CHDK dark frame subtraction control only seems effective when Canon setting is on AUTO

Tested (using 15-45 kit lens)

- Exposure overrides in (semi-)manual modes (not very extensively)
- CHDK RAW/DNG in (semi-)manual modes (Av, Tv, M, P) (not very extensively)
- PTP play/rec switch
- llibtst.lua
- setmode.lua - one failure with default 10ms delay, works with 100ms
- ubtest.bas
- hooktest.lua (Av, Tv, M, P)
- isobase.lua
- PTP live view (has problems with overlay dimensions, only 3:2 aspect ratio tested)
- Motion detection (reaction time not tested)
- USB remote - plug test
- chdkptp cam tests

Untested

- RAW/DNG, overrides in scene/auto modes

Not implemented

- Extra long exposures (firmware limit is 30 seconds)
- CHDK touchscreen functionality
- CHDK mirrorless camera support is not complete
    - Zoom related functionality is missing (except for focal length display)
    - Most focus related functions are not working and are untested
- Movie features are missing
- Filewritetask is not currently supported

Developer notes

- [WORKED AROUND] Camera crashes with "Vector 0x37" (??) exception if spytask starts too soon (??).
    Guesses: 
        - too early use of the busyonscreen functions ?
          Worked around, using a flag from "GUISrv_StartGUISystem_FW".
          Does not help. Works if _GetLogToFile() is called prior to shooting_init() in spytask.
        - spytask calls something else too early
