EOS M3 notes

This is an INCOMPLETE, UNFINISHED PORT.
Many features and combinations of Canon settings have not been tested.
Only for firmware version 1.0.1 (GM1.01A (1.0.1.0))

Issues:

- CHDK overlay drawing is slow
- many GUI modules don't respect screen resolution
- some framebuffer related features do not work, including
 - zebra
 - histogram
 - custom auto iso overexposure protection
- movie features are not supported
- movie_status is wrong

TESTED:

PTP play/rec switch
raw and remote hooks (in normal still shooting modes, broken some special modes)
USB remote - plug test / remote hook only
CHDK raw / DNG (in P, M, Tv, Av modes. AUTO not well tested, many others broken)
PTP remote shoot with JPEG / CHDK DNG
 - If Canon raw is enabled, it will be downloaded instead of jpeg, with jpeg extension.
 - If Canon raw + jpeg is enabled, the jpeg will be written to the card
 - May fail in special scene modes (not extensively tested)
Motion detection - preliminary
Edge overlay - preliminary
PTP live view - preliminary, requires updated client with live view proto 2.2 support

NOT IMPLEMENTED:

dark frame control
video controls (movie_rec task)
reboot with firmware update file
script hard shutdown (shut_down(1))
booting with .fi2, camera crashes
