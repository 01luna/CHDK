EOS M3 notes

This is an INCOMPLETE, UNFINISHED PORT.
Many features and combinations of Canon settings have not been tested.
Only for firmware version 1.0.1 (GM1.01A (1.0.1.0))

Please post bug reports and patches in the porting thread

Issues:

- CHDK overlay drawing is slow
- many GUI modules don't respect screen resolution
- some framebuffer related features do not work, including
 - zebra
 - histogram
 - custom auto iso overexposure protection
 - Edge overlay (preliminary code exists in Ant's branch)
- movie features are not supported
- movie_status is wrong

TESTED:

PTP play/rec switch
raw and remote hooks (in normal still shooting modes, broken some special modes)
USB remote - plug test / remote hook only
CHDK raw / DNG (in P, M, Tv, Av modes. AUTO not well tested, many others broken)
PTP remote shoot with JPEG / CHDK DNG
 - If Canon raw is enabled, it will be downloaded instead of jpeg, with jpeg extension.
 - If Canon raw + jpeg is enabled, the jpeg will be written to the card
 - May fail in special scene modes (not extensively tested)
Motion detection - preliminary
PTP live view - preliminary, requires client with live view protocol 2.2 (chdkptp r723 or later)

NOT IMPLEMENTED:

dark frame control
video controls (movie_rec task)
reboot with firmware update file
script hard shutdown (shut_down(1))
booting with .fi2, camera crashes
