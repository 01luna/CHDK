Issues:

- Movie features are not supported. Movie_status is wrong.
- Not all features have been tested fully, expect issues and crashes.
- Edge detection does not work correctly when using the EVF.
- Zebra and edge detection are disabled when connected to HDMI.
  The viewport becomes 1920x1080; but the UI overlay (bitmap) remains 720x480. The code does not handle this.
- CHDKPTP live view does not work correctly if using the EVF.
- If the 'AF Method' is set to 'Face+Tracking' (Canon SHOOT3 menu), then the CHDK UI and OSD will flicker a lot more when in record mode.
  To minimise flickering, use '1-point AF', or open the CHDK menu in playback mode, or open the Canon menu first before using the CHDK menu.
  If using Face+Tracking AF it is probably best to turn off the CHDK OSD elements (battery, clock, etc).

Working and mostly tested:

- Edge detection (see above)
- Zebra (see above)
- Motion detection
- Auto-iso live view historgram
- PTP, scripts, overrides, seem to be functional.
- CHDK RAW & DNG works (not tested in all modes).
- Clean overlay is possible for HDMI output purposes: See "Video Parameters" -> "Clear Canon overlays"
  "Rec": Canon overlay is removed upon entering shooting (aka rec) mode
  "MviRec": Canon overlay is removed when recording video
  CHDK overlay needs to be removed separately, in the "CHDK Settings" menu.
