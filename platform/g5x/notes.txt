Issues:

- Movie features are not supported. Movie_status is wrong.
- Booting with .fi2 is disabled (not working).
- Not all features have been tested fully, expect issues and crashes

Working and mostly tested:

- Edge detection
- Zebra
- Motion detection
- Auto-iso live view historgram
- PTP, scripts, overrides, seem to be functional.
- CHDK RAW & DNG works (not tested in all modes).
