EOS M10 notes

Default ALT button is the playback button.

The half press zebra shortcut button is "UP" on the 4-way controller.

The RAW shortcut (and generic shortcut) button is the VIDEO button.

Notes

- To select a digit in a CHDK menu numeric field, press the shutter halfway

- To achieve card speeds greater than 20MB/s, card is now powered off during CHDK start.
  This may result in additional startup delay, depending on card. Reports about card issues

- Video bitrate can be adjusted (CBR, VBR). Maximum possible video bitrate is approx. 41000 kbit/s

- Video time based limits are raised to 3 hours

- Clean overlay is possible for HDMI output purposes: See "Video Parameters" -> "Clear Canon overlays"
  "Rec": Canon overlay is removed upon entering shooting (aka rec) mode
  "MviRec": Canon overlay is removed when recording video
  CHDK overlay needs to be removed separately, in the "CHDK Settings" menu.

- This camera can switch on itself after a user-initiated delay. This feature can be used from a user-written Lua script.

Issues

- CHDK overlay drawing is slow, can blink excessively when the Canon OSD is updated
- CHDK overlay flickers (making the CHDK menu unusable) in the following cases:
  - in hybrid auto mode
  - when face tracking auto focus enabled
  - there are animated drawings on the Canon display

- some games don't display correcly
- some framebuffer related features do not work properly
    - zebra (some menu options are ignored)
    - edge overlay (drawings accumulate)
- booting with .fi2 does not work (update file error)
- CHDK dark frame subtraction control only seems effective when Canon setting is on AUTO

- Exposure overrides may fail to apply when shutter is held halfway down for a while
    - this does not happen when an AF lens is attached and auto focus succeeds
    - does not happen in M mode
    - does not happen when AE is locked using the Canon controls (asterisk on the 4-way controller)

- Exposure overrides may also fail to apply when the shutter is pressed too quickly


Tested (using 15-45 kit lens)

- Exposure overrides in (semi-)manual modes (not very extensively)
- CHDK RAW/DNG in (semi-)manual modes (Av, Tv, M, P) (not very extensively)
- PTP play/rec switch
- llibtst.lua
- setmode.lua - one failure with default 10ms delay, works with 100ms
- ubtest.bas
- hooktest.lua (Av, Tv, M, P)
- isobase.lua
- PTP live view (has problems with overlay dimensions, only 3:2 aspect ratio tested)
- Motion detection (reaction time not tested)
- USB remote - plug test
- chdkptp cam tests
- bracketing in continuous mode - Tv, ISO works, Av also seems to work

Untested

- RAW/DNG, overrides in scene/auto modes

Not implemented

- CHDK touchscreen functionality
- CHDK mirrorless camera support is not complete
    - Zoom related functionality is missing (except for focal length display)
    - Most focus related functions are not working and are untested
- Filewritetask is not currently supported

Developer notes

- [WORKED AROUND] Camera crashes with "Vector 0x37" (??) exception if spytask starts too soon (??).
    Guesses: 
        - too early use of the busyonscreen functions ?
          Worked around, using a flag from "GUISrv_StartGUISystem_FW".
          Does not help. Works if _GetLogToFile() is called prior to shooting_init() in spytask.
        - spytask calls something else too early
