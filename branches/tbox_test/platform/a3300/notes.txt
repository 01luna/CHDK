A3300 notes

WARNING WARNING WARNING

This is an *incomplete* alpha port, done by an person with limited programming experience. It has known issues, and likely many unknown issues.

If you are an experienced programmer with this camera, you may want to start from scratch rather than trying to fix this port.
Most of the comments are probably copy/pasted from other ports, DO NOT TRUST THEM.

If you are an end user and somehow obtained a build of this, you should proceed with caution and assume that things will be broken.
