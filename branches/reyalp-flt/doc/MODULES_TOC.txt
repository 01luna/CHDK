TUTORIAL:

Changes of GUI infrastructure
How to make simple GUI module
How to make dynamic library
What if elf2flt say "unresolved symbol"
What if elf2flt say "only ABS32 could be imported"
What if I need defines from CHDK
 a) simple way - make platform dependencies
		this is only way if #if used in module
 b) platform independent way
Notes:
-how to unload. when do not unload
-access to conf.
-how to load dll in module (rawop in fselect)

What need to pay attention:
- sanity clear of gui magic num on unload
- keep communications variable in core chdk (to prevent point to unloaded module)
- make unload sequence if need to free allocated resource
- unload shared dynamic libraries: 
	a) lock by "semaphore" owning flags - unload if noone more own
    b) be sure that no interrupted calls which will call and then just check load every time
