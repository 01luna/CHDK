****************************************
Development notes:

Override Subj. Dist. only works if camera is put in AFL mode and then use a script to take the picture.

Other overrides (eg. Shutter speed) might need AFL mode too, or at least wait untill Auto Focus finishes, or they might be ignored.

Unlocking optical zoom in VIDEO mode has been disable, since it works only once and then freezes zoom controls.

Version specific notes:

* 100B & 100C:

	To shoot images with lua over PTP, first put the camera in "mode 1" and back to "mode 0" before using it normaly or it might crash.
	
* 100D
	
	If compiled with PTP, using lua scripts on camera might crash it, BASIC scripts work fine. Lua over PTP also works fine.
	
	To shoot images with lua over PTP, first put the camera in "mode 1" and back to "mode 0" before using it normaly or it might crash.
	
	When CHDK boots up, OSD colors might be wrong, they change back to normal after first action (eg. taking a picture or changing camera modes).
