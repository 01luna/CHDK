Additional merge notes from reyalp
bitmap related defines in platform_camera.h probably need to be updated to current trunk style
bitmap related functions in platform/sub/lib.c probably need to be updated
led.c in platform/sub/100a is probably not needed
modemap appears to be incomplete, per stubs_entry.S
task hooks should use addresses from stubs_entry rather than strcmp
