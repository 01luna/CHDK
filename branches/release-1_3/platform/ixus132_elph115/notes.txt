*** IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION ***
The 100b firmware of ixus135_elph120 is identical to ixus132_elph115 100b.
Differences are:
- PLATFORMID in makefile.inc
- The ixus135_elph120 has built-in Wi-Fi (not currently used by CHDK)
- platform_camera.h (name in header only)
- notes.txt
Any code changes made to one camera should probably be applied to the other.
