To enter CHDK <ALT> mode use the [>] Play button.
This may be changed to Video in the options

This camera does not have an adjustable aperture. It does have an ND filter

CHDK is a hack, use at your own risk!


For Developers
- Liveview has not been tested
- movie_rec.c is missing

*** IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION ***
The 100b firmware of ixus135_elph120 is identical to ixus132_elph115 100b.
Differences are:
- PLATFORMID in makefile.inc
- The ixus135_elph120 has built-in Wi-Fi (not currently used by CHDK)
- platform_camera.h (name in header only)
- notes.txt
Any code changes made to one camera should probably be applied to the other.
