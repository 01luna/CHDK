SX520 Notes
************************************
To enter CHDK <ALT> mode use the [>] Play button.

CHDK is a hack, use at your own risk!

Known issues

The camera's "front dial" (scrollwheel on the top) is not supported by CHDK.
The back dial can be used to scroll in the CHDK menu, but its scroll events go through the Canon UI and may change settings inadvertently.

Developer notes

This port is a copy of the SX530HS port. The 1.00c versions of SX520HS and SX530HS firmwares are virtually identical.
Any future changes to the original port should probably be reflected here too.
'SX530' references are kept in source in order to keep differences at a minimum.

The scrollwheel issues need either a developer or a reliable tester, see "JogDial_task_my" in boot.c.

Known differences:
- No wifi and NFC
- Long end of zoom is limited (most likely in software)
- The 'mobile device connection' button is labelled as 'drive mode' button
- Different PLATFORMID
