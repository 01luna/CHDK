************************************
IXUS140 / ELPH130IS Notes 
************************************
To enter CHDK <ALT> mode use the [>] Play button.
This may be changed to Video in the options, but this conflicts with some shortcuts.

This camera does not have an adjustable aperture. It does have an ND filter

This is a beta port, use at your own risk!

TESTED
******
shutter, iso and ND override (not comprehensively)
llibtst.lua
ubtest.bas
ptp control, rec/play switching
RAW/DNG capture
zebra
PTP live view, but note fisheye mode issue below
led functions
dark frame control - note overrides outside of long shutter mode do not appear to trigger auto dark frame
usb remote hook - only tested with plug / unplug test
current bitmap buffer
fast live view buffer
extra long exposures / exp_drv task
remote capture / filewrite hook, but note crash on switching to playback issue below

NOT IMPLEMENTED
***************
video functions / movie_rec task
exmem support (note, camera has ~1.7 mb regular heap free on startup with CHDK)

OTHER ISSUES
************
Folder naming and file counter use a new method, seem to be working but may have issues
Not clear if fast press override hack is needed, needs more testing
subject distance override is only available in AF lock or CHDK 1.3 set_mf
If using set_aflock from script in CHDK 1.2, you must use set the AF_LOCK propcase to 1 for sd override to work
If the alt key is set to video, the raw/debug shortcut will not work
The hide OSD when pressing DISP in half shoot shortcut is not available, since the camera has no DISP key

KNOWN BUGS
**********
DNG color matrix is copy+paste from D10
PTP Live view and functions like zebra, histogram do not work correctly in fisheye effect mode
Zoom lever doesn't work when zoom has been set to something other than 0 with set_zoom. set_zoom(0) allows it to work again
The camera crashes if you use PTP remoteshoot (or shoot and delete files) and then switch to playback mode
