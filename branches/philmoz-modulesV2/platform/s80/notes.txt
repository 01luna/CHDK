Current source is based on the source provided by Lionfish, with the following changes:

- several addresses have been corrected (functions, firmware variables)
- jogdial is supported
- no special shortcuts are defined
- DNG should work, but will have black borders (until someone defines the active area)

Not changed:

- capt_seq.c and movie_rec.c is unverified, mostly untouched
