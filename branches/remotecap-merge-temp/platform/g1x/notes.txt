Alpha CHDK for G1X.

****************************************
Development notes:
---
Known issues:
    - Currently only firmware 1.00f is supported.
    - Raw images can be saved as DNG; but DNG version 1.3 must be used (bad pixel creation will not work for DNG 1.1)
    - CHDK native RAW image format will be 14 bits-per-pixel which nothing supports (not recommended for use)
