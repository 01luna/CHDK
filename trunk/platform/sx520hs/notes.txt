SX520 Notes
************************************
To enter CHDK <ALT> mode use the [>] Play button.

This is an early, incomplete alpha port, use at your own risk!

Video features are not supported for now.

Developer notes

This port is a copy of the SX530HS port. The 1.00c versions of SX520HS and SX530HS firmwares are virtually identical.
Any future changes to the original port should probably be reflected here too.
'SX530' references are kept in source in order to keep differences at a minimum.

Known differences:
- No wifi and NFC
- Long end of zoom is limited (most likely in software)
- The 'mobile device connection' button is labelled as 'drive mode' button
- Different PLATFORMID
