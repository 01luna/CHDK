CHDK is a hack, use at your own risk!

This is an ALPHA port. Some CHDK features are not implemented and
many have not been fully tested.

General camera and CHDK port information
****************************************
Default alt button is PLAY. ERASE and VIDEO may also be used, but will
conflict with some CHDK shortcuts

Raw shortcut key is VIDEO

Has ND filter, does NOT have adjustable aperture

~3MB of RAM is available to CHDK

Neither VER.REQ nore VERS.REQ work to obtain the Canon firmware. Use
a tool such as ACID to obtain the correct firmware version

Analog AV detect and battery temperature A/D are supported as alternate remote inputs.
