SX730 HS notes
************************************
This is a lightly tested PREALPHA port. CHDK is a hack, use at your own risk!

General camera and CHDK port information
****************************************
Default alt button is PLAY. VIDEO and WIFI may also be used. Long press to
access the original function of the assigned alt button.

SX730 has an adjustable aperture and does not have an ND filter.

SX730 automatically powers on when connected to a USB host. It enters charging
mode when connected to a USB charger. CHDK does not appear to interfere with
these functions, but it has not been tested extensively. Beware that applying
USB power with the CHDK USB remote enabled could cause the camera to power on
and extend the lens.

When connected to a USB host, the camera only charges over USB after the 
GetObjectHandles opcode has been received. This opcode would normally be sent by
standard photo software to list images on the camera. On systems configured
for use with chdkptp, this opcode will not normally be sent, so the camera 
will not charge unless it is sent manually, for example using using gphoto to
list images or !con:ptp_get_object_handles() in chdkptp.
After GetObjectHandles is received, the camera display will turn off and the
camera will not be able to switch to shooting mode until disconnected or
rebooted.

The framing assist key is assigned to ERASE for CHDK functionality and script.

The half press shortcut for zebra toggle is MENU

The half press shortcut for histogram toggle is disabled, due to limited keys.

Subject distance (focus) override is supported in AFLock and MF, not in AF.

~800 KB of free RAM is available. This should be enough for normal operation.

set_led id 0 controls the green indicator LED, 1 controls the AF assist LED.
Control of the orange charge indicator is not currently available.

TESTED
******
- PTP operation, including live view
- Shutter, aperture and ISO override
- Focus override. MF or AF lock is required 
- Bracketing in continuous mode
- llibtst.lua (see known bugs)
- hooktest.lua (see known bugs)
- ISO base, real/market conversion
- Propset values
- Fast MD - MD_Tune.bas response times  40-70ms
- USB remote (see known bugs)
- "Firm update" boot
- Dark frame subtraction control
- Raw / DNG. Not all modes tested, works in P, M, Tv, Av at least

NOT IMPLEMENTED
***************
- Jpeg remote shoot. File write task does not exist in this firmware.
- Video controls (movie_rec task)
- Reboot with firmware update file
- Script hard shutdown (shut_down(1))
- Changing UI resolution for HDMI out
- Script backlight control (set_backlight)

OTHER ISSUES
************
- Display updating is ugly / has usual Digic 6 limitations
  - Flashes a lot if the Canon firmware is updating the display
  - Edge overlay does not erase properly when shown live
  - Zebra "Draw Over Zebra" and Restore options are non-functional
  - Some games don't draw correctly
- DNG color matrix is incorrect (copied from sx60hs) but usable

KNOWN BUGS
**********
- USB remote may shoot multiple shots in continuous mode (this is a general
  CHDK issue)
- Timestamps on files created before a shot is taken may be 1/1/2000 
  This causes a failure in llibtst.lua (this is a general CHDK issue)
