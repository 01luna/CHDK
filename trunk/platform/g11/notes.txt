Camera depending notes:

- manual loading (with "firmware update" from the Canon menu) DOES NOT work yet
- G11 uses (new) Propset 3 of properties
- G11 uses new color palette 
- dryos with changed behaviour to previous dryos versions (stat() funtion, max. path length, etc.)
- G11 has an ND Filter AND real iris diaphragm. ND Filter feature in camera.h is disabled, because
  camera asserts if ND-Filter state is changed via CHDK.
- 100j and 100k are the same, development is done in the 100j tree
