EOS M10 notes

Default ALT button is the playback button.

The half press zebra shortcut button is "UP" on the 4-way controller.

The RAW shortcut (and generic shortcut) button is the VIDEO button.

Issues

- To start the cam with the playback button, hold down the button a little longer
- To select a digit in a CHDK menu numeric field, press the shutter halfway

- CHDK overlay drawing is slow, can blink excessively when the Canon OSD is updated
- some games don't display correcly
- some framebuffer related features do not work properly
    - zebra (some menu options are ignored)
    - edge overlay (drawings accumulate)
- booting with .fi2 does not work (update file error)
- CHDK dark frame subtraction control only seems effective when Canon setting is on AUTO

- Exposure overrides may fail to apply when shutter is held halfway down for a while
    - this does not happen when an AF lens is attached and auto focus succeeds
    - does not happen in M mode
    - does not happen when AE is locked using the Canon controls (asterisk on the 4-way controller)

- To achieve card speeds greater than 20MB/s, card is now powered off during CHDK start.
  This may result in additional startup delay, depending on card. Reports about card issues

Tested (using 15-45 kit lens)

- Exposure overrides in (semi-)manual modes (not very extensively)
- CHDK RAW/DNG in (semi-)manual modes (Av, Tv, M, P) (not very extensively)
- PTP play/rec switch
- llibtst.lua
- setmode.lua - one failure with default 10ms delay, works with 100ms
- ubtest.bas
- hooktest.lua (Av, Tv, M, P)
- isobase.lua
- PTP live view (has problems with overlay dimensions, only 3:2 aspect ratio tested)
- Motion detection (reaction time not tested)
- USB remote - plug test
- chdkptp cam tests

Untested

- RAW/DNG, overrides in scene/auto modes

Not implemented

- CHDK touchscreen functionality
- CHDK mirrorless camera support is not complete
    - Zoom related functionality is missing (except for focal length display)
    - Most focus related functions are not working and are untested
- Movie features are missing
- Filewritetask is not currently supported

Developer notes

- [WORKED AROUND] Camera crashes with "Vector 0x37" (??) exception if spytask starts too soon (??).
    Guesses: 
        - too early use of the busyonscreen functions ?
          Worked around, using a flag from "GUISrv_StartGUISystem_FW".
          Does not help. Works if _GetLogToFile() is called prior to shooting_init() in spytask.
        - spytask calls something else too early
