************************************
G7 X notes
************************************
This is an INCOMPLETE, UNFINISHED PORT.
Many features and combinations of Canon settings have not been tested.

CHDK is a hack, use at your own risk!
This is a new port for a model with many hardware differences from previously
supported models, so it is probably higher risk than most.

The VER.REQ/VERS.REQ method does not work to obtain the Canon firmware
version, use ACID or the firminfo Canon Basic script.

General camera and CHDK port information
****************************************
G7 X has an adjustable aperture and ND filter.

SD override does not work in AF, only MF or AF lock.

Default alt button is PLAY, VIDEO and WIFI may also be used

To start in shooting mode or wifi connect, hold down the corresponding button

Raw blacklevel appears to be ~511, not the ~127 seen on other 12 bit cams

G7 X uses propset 7. The values used in some propcases have changed.

TESTED
******
llibtst.lua
chdkptp cam tests
PTP play/rec switch
raw and remote hooks (in normal still shooting modes, broken some special modes)
ND override
SD override
Tv, Av and bracketing
ISO overrides and bracketing
 - may have issues, full range not tested, some unexpected results in cont mode.
setmode.lua - crashes with default 10ms delay, works with 100ms
ubtest.bas
hooktest.lua
isobase.lua
USB remote - plug test / remote hook only
CHDK raw / DNG (in P, M, Tv, Av modes. AUTO not well tested, many others broken)
PTP remote shoot with JPEG / CHDK DNG
 - If Canon raw is enabled, it will be downloaded instead of jpeg, with jpeg extension.
 - If Canon raw + jpeg is enabled, the jpeg will be written to the card
 - May fail in special scene modes (not extensively tested)

NOT IMPLEMENTED
***************
dark frame control
 - canon firmware enables darkframe for exposures over 30 sec
video controls (movie_rec task)
movie_status
extra long exposures (exp_drv task)
 - canon firmware supports up to 250 sec
reboot with firmware update file
script hard shutdown (shut_down(1))

OTHER ISSUES
************
display updating is ugly. Below from sx280hs also applies to G7 X
- framebuffer related features do not work, including
 - zebra
 - histogram
 - edge overlay
 - custom auto iso overexposure protection
 - ptp live view
- CHDK UI is erased / flashes every time low battery icons

PROPCASE_RESOLUTION values differ from previous models
- 0=L (20MP) 2=M1 (12MP) 3=M2 (4MP) 5=S (720x480) (sizes at 3:2 aspect)

Occasional "SD card error" messages after boot seen in testing.
Unclear if CHDK related, has gone away after reboot.

Occasional very slow uploads with chdkptp.

KNOWN BUGS
**********
- CHDK raw and remote hooks are not called in some special shooting modes (HDR, star trails etc)
  This means script shoot() calls, scripts that use shoot hooks and synced remote do not function
  correctly in these modes. This mostly affects modes that take multiple exposures for a single jpeg
- CHDK raw address not correct in most special effect / scene modes
  Using CHDK DNG in modes with an incorrect raw address may result in memory corruption and
  potentially even hardware damage.
- When booted with FI2 update, switching to hybrid auto causes a crash
