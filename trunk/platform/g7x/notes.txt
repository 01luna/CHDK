G7x notes
************************************
This is an INCOMPLETE, MOSTLY UNTESTED PORT.
Many shooting related features not implemented or not tested.

CHDK is a hack, use at your own risk!

This camera has an adjustable aperture and ND filter.

SD override does not work in AF, only MF or AF lock.

Default alt button is PLAY

Raw blacklevel appears to be ~511, not the ~127 seen on other 12 bit cams
