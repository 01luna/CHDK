G7 X notes
************************************
CHDK is a hack, use at your own risk!

This is an ALPHA port. It has some known bugs, and many features and
combinations of Canon settings have not been tested thoroughly.

Additionally, Digic 6 has significant differences from previously 
supported models, which means some features are not fully implemented
and the risk of unforeseen side effects is higher than ports for
previous Digic versions.

The VER.REQ/VERS.REQ method does not work to obtain the Canon firmware
version, use ACID or the firminfo Canon Basic script.

No "firmware update" file is included in the autobuild, you must used
bootable SD card to load. See known bugs below.

General camera and CHDK port information
****************************************
G7 X has an adjustable aperture and ND filter

SD override does not work in AF, only MF or AF lock

Default alt button is PLAY. VIDEO and WIFI may also be used

The RING FUNC key is identified as ERASE in scripting and CHDK shortcuts

The half press zebra shortcut keys is MENU

To start in shooting mode or wifi connect, hold down the corresponding button

Raw blacklevel appears to be ~511, not the ~127 seen on other 12 bit cams

G7 X uses propset 7. The values used in some propcases have changed, which
can break compatibility with scripts.

Only simple_movie_status is implemented, so features or scripts that rely on
direct access to the movie_status variable do not work

TESTED
******
llibtst.lua
chdkptp cam tests
PTP play/rec switch
raw and remote hooks (in normal still shooting modes, broken some special modes)
ND override
SD override
Tv, Av and bracketing
ISO overrides and bracketing
 - may have issues, full range not tested, some unexpected results in cont mode.
setmode.lua - crashes with default 10ms delay, works with 100ms
ubtest.bas
hooktest.lua
isobase.lua
USB remote - plug test / remote hook only
CHDK raw / DNG - In most still modes that take a single exposure, see Known Bugs below
PTP remote shoot with JPEG / CHDK DNG
 - If Canon raw is enabled, it will be downloaded instead of jpeg, with jpeg extension.
 - If Canon raw + jpeg is enabled, the jpeg will be written to the card
 - Fails in modes that take multiple exposures: Canon firmware bracketing,
   HDR, Creative shot etc
Motion detection - Note version of mdfb2013.lua up to 1.1a is not compatible
PTP live view - Requires client with live view proto 2.2 support
 (chdkptp r712 or later)
Zebra, histogram and Edge overlay - with limitations, see Other Issues below.
Dark frame control
 - If set to auto Canon firmware uses DFS for tv 5-30 sec, depending on ISO and temperature

NOT IMPLEMENTED
***************
video controls (movie_rec task)
extra long exposures (exp_drv task)
 - Canon firmware supports up to 250 sec
reboot with firmware update file
script hard shutdown (shut_down(1))

OTHER ISSUES
************
display updating is ugly
- CHDK UI is erased / flashes every time Canon UI updates, including
  focus boxes, low battery icon etc.
- Edge overlay does not erase properly when shown live
- Zebra "Draw Over Zebra" and Restore options are non-functional
- Some games don't draw correctly

PROPCASE_RESOLUTION values differ from previous models
- 0=L (20MP) 2=M1 (12MP) 3=M2 (4MP) 5=S (720x480) (sizes at 3:2 aspect)
PROPCASE_IS_MODE values differ from some previous
- 0=Continuous, 1=Shoot Only, 2=Off.
  Setting other values (as done by mdfb2013.lua up to 1.1a) causes crash on shutdown.

KNOWN BUGS
**********
- CHDK raw and remote hooks are not called in some special shooting modes (HDR, star trails etc)
  This means script shoot() calls, scripts that use shoot hooks and synced remote do not function
  correctly in these modes. This mostly affects modes that take multiple exposures for a single jpeg
- CHDK raw / DNG may not work correctly in some other special scene modes
- When booted with FI2 update
 - switching to hybrid auto causes a crash
 - orientation sensor value alternates between 0 and 90
 Because of these issues, an FI2 file is not included in the autobuild
- When using remote shoot, DCIM directories will be created even if no files are saved
