Issues

- CHDK overlay drawing is slow
- many GUI modules don't respect screen resolution
- most framebuffer related features do not work, including
 - zebra
 - histogram
 - edge overlay
 - custom auto iso overexposure protection
- movie features are not supported
- when booting with .fi2, switching the cam to hybrid auto mode results in an immediate err 9 (JPEGTimeOut)...


Development notes

- the current overlay drawing method is slow, should be replaced
  (overlay is 16bpp yuv, a separate 8bpp opacity buffer has to be written too)
- screen refresh method is not optimal, slow, the guard pixel gets erased each time the battery warning blinks
- all viewport related routines and modules have to be rewritten
 - to handle other resolutions and aspect ratio
 - to handle the new yuv format(s)

- don't forget to transform pc-relative loads into ldr instructions when using objdump output
- when using ldr pc, =... always check the target instruction set and use the appropriate thumb bit
- always check the instruction set of every needed fw function and use the appropriate thumb bit (for stubs)
- be careful with jumptables, 'tbb' may run out of addressable space when inserting new instructions into fw code
- tbb jumptables have to be explicitly aligned, the assembler won't notice alignment problems
- objdump tends to lose sync when it tries to disassemble data blocks, some instructions need to be recovered manually
