Issues

- Not a fully working port.
- Screen update in CHDK menu has problems in record mode (sometimes displays old frame).
- Memory browser may crash if it tries to dereference an invalid address.
- Edge overlay and Zebra do not work if the camera is connected to a HDMI display.
  The viewport becomes 1920x1080; but the UI overlay (bitmap) remains 720x480. The code does not handle this.
  Zebra may crash the camera if used with HDMI output.

Development notes:

- Booting via diskboot and firmware update both work.
- Screen draw working, CHDK menus working.
- Core functionality working. Config save/load, debug menu, games, tools, file browser, scripts etc.
- PTP working including live view and UI overlay
- Edge detection, zebra and histogram work (see note above).
- MovieRecord task not implemented.
- DNG files created by CHDK do not load correctly in latest Adobe ACR / Lightroom.
  Appears to be an Adobe bug. Files load in RawTherapee, darktable, digikam, and RawDigger.
