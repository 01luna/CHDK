S100 NOTES

- Alt shortcut: 
adjustable, default is the play button. Hold for 1/2 second for original function

- This camera is able to boot from FAT32 cards when the appropriate BOOTDISK string is written
- The 'ring func' button is treated as the 'ERASE' button in CHDK shortcuts and scripting.

CAMERA TODO/KNOWN ISSUES:
- manual loading with "firm update" loading crashes (confirmed on 100d and 101a), so PS.FI2 is not included in the autobuild. (to be fixed soon http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=7889.msg85060#msg85060)
- various defines in platform_camera.h needs to be checked

- 100d, 100e, 101a: movie override quality seems to be working but values might be wrong (stock Canon reaches 4MB/s, CHDK quality 99 2MB/s)
