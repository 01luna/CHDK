Issues:

- The CHDK menu display overlay may briefly flash onscreen after the menu is closed.
- Movie features are not supported. Movie_status is wrong.
- Booting with .fi2 is disabled (not working).
- Not all features have been tested fully, expect issues and crashes

Working and mostly tested:

- Edge detection works but is slow and flickers in record mode.
- Zebra works but is slow and flickers badly.
- Motion detection works.
- Auto-iso live view historgram works.
- PTP, scripts, overrides, seem to be functional.
- CHDK RAW & DNG works (not tested in all modes).

Development notes:

- Bitmap display for CHDK OSD, menus etc uses the camera YUV overlay buffers like the other Digic 6 ports; however
    - The buffer is 736x480 (visible = 720x480) so the normal 8x16 font size is used, not the 14x32 custom rendering.
    - The bitmap is treated as a 368x240 display to match the CHDK virtual screen size, 2x scaling is done by plotting 2x2 YUV pixels for each CHDK pixel.
      This fits nicely with the YUV bitmap which uses 4 bytes for each 2 pixels (YVYU).
    - The 2x scaling is done entirely in the gui_draw code, there is no ASPECT_CORRECTION like the older cameras use.
    - Live view sends the correct width & height sizes for the YUV buffer (same as the other Digic6 ports).
