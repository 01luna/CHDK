Porting thread: https://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php?topic=9133.0

Camera has no adjustable aperture, only an ND filter.
- As a wide screen model, it has some issues: 
    Operation with TV out is not supported (right side of CHDK OSD is clipped, zebra, histogram wrong)

- zebra & histogram, liveview over ptp can be wrong in stitch mode (untested)

- On/Off button acts as the "shortcut button" when in ALT mode, exit ALT to switch the cam off!

- ALT button is the Play [>] button (short press), long press = original function

- exmem allocation is forced due to insufficient amount of free RAM

Other notes
- Some overrides (Tv?) may be ignored for the first shot after a play -> rec mode transition.
- The camera may engage the ND filter in bright light, but take the picture without it (not CHDK related).
- A user reported a bricked camera using CHDK, possibly due to loading a build for the worng firmware version:
